## Overview
The **Advanced Encryption Tool** is a Python-based project designed to securely encrypt and decrypt files using the **Fernet (AES)** encryption algorithm from the `cryptography` library. It ensures data confidentiality by converting sensitive files into unreadable formats and allows authorized users to decrypt them safely.

## Features
- Generate a unique encryption key.
- Encrypt text or file data using Fernet encryption.
- Decrypt files safely with the original key.
- Prevent unauthorized access or data leaks.
- Simple and secure command-line interface.

---

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Cryptography (Fernet module)
- File handling and I/O operations

---

## How It Works
1. Generate an encryption key (`encryption_key.key`).
2. Use the encryption script to encrypt a file.
3. Store the encrypted file securely.
4. Use the decryption script with the same key to decrypt it.
